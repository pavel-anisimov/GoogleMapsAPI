2.	Google Map
a.	display all stores
b.	display top-n stores based on proximity to user’s location

3.	Geocoder component
 .	     a.  geocode the store locations
     b.  geocode the user location

4.	Calculate and display distances from user to the stores (can be all or top-n)

5.	Calculate and display directions (path on map and textual directions) between user location and user-selected store

Good-to-have (bonus) components:

1.	Auto-complete functionality when user types address
2.	Responsive design – application looks good and is functional on diverse devices and screen sizes
3.	Cross browser compliant (application looks and is functional in all browsers, including – IE 8 and above)
